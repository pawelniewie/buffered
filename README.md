# Hi, this is Buffered
The friendly library for http://bufferapp.com. This small Mac SDK is a nice helper if you want to use Buffer.

# Under development
It's currently under the development so some methods are lacking, any contributions are welcome.

# How to get started
Install Cocoapods if you haven't already (http://cocoapods.org)
Clone the repository from https://github.com/pawelniewie/buffered
Open terminal and go to the checked out workspace.
Run "pod install"
Run "open Buffered.xcworkspace"

Xcode will start - you can now build Buffered or Buffered Example to check it out.

# In case of questions
Feel free to contact the author.
